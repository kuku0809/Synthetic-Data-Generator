# Synthetic-Data-Generator

This project introduces a novel approach to synthetic tabular data generation using Conditional Tabular GANs (CTGAN) augmented with agentic workflows and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system allows users to interact via a chatbot interface to specify data constraints and sample inputs, which are then expanded intelligently by an AI agent pipeline. We leverage ChromaDB to retrieve semantically relevant historical datasets, ensuring schema consistency and enhancing data realism.
